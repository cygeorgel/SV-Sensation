# Laurence's Cove (Bere Island)

## From Cape Clear Island to Bere Island (Laurence's Cove)  - 30/07/2025

### Crew

- Cyrille Georgel (Skipper)
- Rachel Georgel

### Narrative

We left our anchorage at Cape Clear Island at 04:45, heading out into heavy fog and rain that lasted all day. Covered less ground than planned and eventually stopped at Laurence’s Cove Marina on Bere Island.

We were here exactly 15 years ago with the RM 1050 Tiramisu — and the marina is still just as welcoming.
