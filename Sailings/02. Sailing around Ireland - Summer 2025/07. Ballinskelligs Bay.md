# Ballinskelligs Bay

## From Bere Island (Laurence's Cove) to Ballinskelligs Bay - 31/07/2025

### Crew

- Cyrille Georgel (Skipper)
- Rachel Georgel

### Narrative

Rachel and I agreed — that was one of our best sailing days ever! The wind was strong enough to sail under two reefs and staysail, and the boat handled beautifully. We averaged 7 knots.

As we entered Ballinskelligs Bay, it was hard to believe we’d find any shelter in such open surroundings. But we eventually dropped anchor near Horse Island. It was still windy, but we were well protected from the swell.
