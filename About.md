# About Sensation

Sensation is  a RM 1060 sailboat, built by Fora Marine in 2013. I bought her in December 2024, after she returned from an Atlantic circuit with her previous owner, Philippe Lointier, and I sailed her to her new home port, Dun Laoghaire (Dublin) in February 2025.

[She is named after the poem by Arthur Rimbaud](01.%20Sensation%20(Arthur%20Rimbaud).md).
