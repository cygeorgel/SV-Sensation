# RM Sailboats : Key Features

RM sailboats are designed to deliver an exceptional sailing experience, blending speed, comfort, and seaworthiness. Built from epoxy plywood, they feature a lightweight yet robust structure that enhances both performance and durability — ideal for sailors who value responsiveness without sacrificing safety.

Most RM models feature a cutter rig, typically with both a genoa and a staysail. This versatile setup allows for easy sail reduction as conditions change, making it especially suitable for short-handed sailing or long-distance cruising.

Inside, RM boats are built with practicality in mind. The inclusion of a dedicated chart table — often large enough to double as a workstation — is a valuable asset for those who spend extended time on board. Whether you're plotting a course or answering emails, this space supports both navigation and remote work.

One of the most distinctive features of the RM range is the large forward windscreen, which brings in natural light and provides excellent visibility from the saloon. This contributes not only to onboard comfort but also to safety at sea, offering a clear view ahead even when sheltered inside.

Finally, RM sailboats offer ample technical storage, including a spacious locker for tools and spare parts. It’s a practical feature that reflects the brand’s focus on long-distance autonomy and self-sufficiency at sea.
