Contrairement à une croyance tenace, le "rail" n'est pas continu en Manche. 

Dans la mesure du possible, nous devrions éviter de traverser dans un TSS.

Dans un TSS, c'est à nous de manoeuvrer, pour passer en sécurité. Il est de prudence élémentaire, en Manche, d'appliquer la même règle entre deux TSS.



The text you've provided seems to focus on maritime navigation, particularly in the English Channel (known as "la Manche" in French). It mentions the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS), which is a maritime traffic-management route system ruled by the International Maritime Organization. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Misconception about Maritime Navigation**: The text dispels a common misconception that there is a continuous "rail" or designated path for ships in the English Channel. This implies that navigation is not as straightforward and requires careful planning.

2. **Avoiding TSS Crossings**: It suggests that, when possible, vessels should avoid crossing within a TSS. This is likely due to the high density of maritime traffic and potential hazards associated with navigating these routes.

3. **Navigating Safely within TSS**: If it becomes necessary to cross or navigate within a TSS, it is up to the vessel's crew to maneuver safely. This involves taking precautions and being aware of other ships' movements to avoid collisions.

4. **Prudence between TSS Areas**: Even when navigating between two separate TSS areas, it’s recommended to exercise caution and apply safe navigation practices similar to those used within a TSS.

This guidance emphasizes the importance of vigilance, safety, and strategic planning in maritime navigation, particularly in heavily trafficked areas like the English Channel.
